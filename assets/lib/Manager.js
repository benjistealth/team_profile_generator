// * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**â€™s:
// * Name
// * Employee ID
// * Email address
// * Office number
// * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
// * Add an engineer
// * Add an intern 
// * Finish building the team

// * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:
// * `officeNumber`
